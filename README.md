# ModDeveloperTools

This is a set of rudimentary tools for mod developers, which may be expanded in the future.

Currently, there's an entity information panel and an item information panel, both of which are toggled with **F10** 
by default.

The entity information panel shows information on your currently selected entity, and the item information panel
shows information on your current cursor stack.

### 0.1.4 (2019-02-27)
 * Add new entity and item prototype flags.
 * Fix a flag being renamed in 0.17.2 that caused all entity flags to report `**Error**`
 * Add `belt_speed`
 * List the technology required to unlock an item's recipes (or the item that builds an entity).
  
### 0.1.3 (2019-02-26)
 * Update for Factorio 0.17
 * Add `group`, `subgroup`, `order`, `fast_replaceable_group` and `collision_mask` to entity info.
 * Minor bugfixes.

### 0.1.2 (2018-10-26)
 * Add a new "magic map seed" feature.  If a new game is started and has this seed, all worldgen will be replaced with
   a pattern of lab tiles.  The default map seed for this feature is 701; it can be disabled by setting it to 0.
 * Add unit_number
 * Add some entity fields concerning connected rail.
 * Fix a possible desync issue.

* Add more item fields
* Fix issue that broke the mod for everyone using it in a zip (oops...)
