# ModDeveloperTools

This is a set of rudimentary tools for mod developers, which may be expanded in the future.

Currently, there's an entity information panel and an item information panel, both of which are toggled with **F10** 
by default.

The entity information panel shows information on your currently selected entity, and the item information panel
shows information on your current cursor stack.
